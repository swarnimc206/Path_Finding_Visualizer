# Pathfinding Visualizer  

## Overview  
This project involves the development of an interactive **Pathfinding Visualizer** using **React.js**. The application allows users to explore and visualize popular pathfinding algorithms, including **BFS**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, and **Bellman-Ford**. The project includes a range of features, such as speed control, maze generation, and manual grid drawing, delivering a comprehensive and engaging user experience.  

## Features  
- Interactive visualization of pathfinding algorithms: **BFS**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, and **Bellman-Ford**.  
- User-friendly interface built with **React.js** and styled using **Tailwind CSS** for responsiveness.  
- Enhanced functionality with **TypeScript** for type safety.  
- Features include:  
  - **Speed Control**: Adjust animation speed for pathfinding exploration.  
  - **Maze Generation**: Automatically generate mazes for testing algorithms.  
  - **Manual Grid Drawing**: Customize grid layout for specific scenarios.  

## Skills and Technologies  
- **Frontend Development**: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford  
- **UI/UX Features**: Speed control, maze generation, manual grid drawing  
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript
